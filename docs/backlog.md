## Items

1. ✅ ~~Spread `client/views` and `src/views` into proper FSD layer directories~~

2. ✅ ~~Deleting a draft from the Upload tab does not refresh the indicator on My Collection → My Uploads~~

3. ✅ ~~Upload progress plate on main page overlaps and replaces the user menu control~~

4. 🟠 **P1** `[bug]` Opening any drawer or menu should close all others
   - Currently the spot preview card stays open when the user menu or My Collection drawer opens

5. 🟠 **P1** `[bug]` Block the Publish button until both price and date are set

6. ✅ ~~When drafts are selected, Publish button should say "Publish {count}" instead of publishing all~~

7. 🟠 **P1** `[bug]` Side panel re-opens on every browser window focus when it was already open; slide-in animation on standalone page load looks broken

8. 🟡 **P2** `[ux]` Spot URLs use raw IDs — should be human-readable slugs
   - **Recommended**: TanStack Router `loader` on `$spotName` route resolves slug → spot entity before component renders
   - `GlobeMapComponent` already accepts `initialSpotId` — routing layer owns the resolution, widget stays routing-agnostic
   - **Option A**: ID-embedded slug (e.g. `/bali-soul--cm9x2k3f4`) — zero-lookup simplicity
   - **Option C**: server loader — clean URLs, requires DB lookup on every navigation

9. 🟢 **P3** `[feature]` *(post-MVP)* "Suggest a better name" — let users propose a new primary name for a spot from the spot panel
   - If accepted: replaces `name`, old name moves to `aliases` so existing searches still resolve

10. 🟡 **P2** `[bug]` Preview card photos stack vertically instead of showing a carousel
    - Decide on source media: last uploaded photo vs. curated admin picks

11. 🔴 **P0** `[security]` Restrict Mapbox public token to production/staging domains in the Mapbox dashboard to prevent quota abuse
    - Dashboard: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/

12. ✅ ~~Audit `useTRPC()` data-fetching patterns and verify all error paths use `shared/errors` utilities (`getErrorMessage`, `ClientErrors`, etc.) consistently~~

13. 🟡 **P2** `[ux]` Add Spot panel is too large — it hides the map; make it more compact

14. 🟡 **P2** `[ux]` Search results: each result item takes too much vertical space

15. ✅ ~~`spots.ts` tRPC route called Prisma directly — extended repository/service pattern to spots (`SpotRepository`)~~

16. 🟢 **P3** `[feature]` Support uploading media from Google Drive
    - **Decision**: do NOT use Cloudinary Upload Widget — it imports Drive files immediately, consuming quota before publish
    - **Architecture**: Google Picker API (client) + server-side Cloudinary URL upload at publish time
      1. User authorises Google Picker (OAuth) — no Cloudinary involved at this step
      2. Picker returns a Drive URL/ID — stored in DB as `media_items.drive_url` with status `DRIVE_PENDING`
      3. At publish: server calls Cloudinary Upload API with `file: driveUrl` — quota consumed only then
    - Keep current XHR pipeline for direct uploads (progress tracking, per-file abort, full UI control)
    - Apply file size/type validation from #36 at the Cloudinary URL-fetch step

17. 🔴 **P0** `[error-handling]` Fix silent swallowing of errors across the codebase

18. 🟠 **P1** `[feature]` Design and implement payment system UX

19. 🟡 **P2** `[feature]` Add per-photographer upload limits with a visual usage indicator

20. 🟡 **P2** `[perf]` Add virtualised lists for all galleries (see also #34)

21. 🟠 **P1** `[bug]` Free photos show watermarks in the lightbox preview — they should not

22. 🟡 **P2** `[ux]` Design UX for displaying original file resolution and metadata

23. 🟠 **P1** `[bug]` Two related issues:
    - Edit price control must enforce a minimum of $3
    - Close the preview card when any drawer opens (not only when dismissed from the card itself — see also #4)

24. 🟡 **P2** `[feature]` Add "Buy Now" that bypasses the cart

25. 🟢 **P3** `[feature]` Decide how video media is handled end-to-end

26. ✅ ~~Users can add their own published media to the cart~~

27. 🟠 **P1** `[error-handling]` Audit server service error handling — apply the same abstract error pattern used in `CheckoutService` consistently across all services

28. ✅ ~~`media.signCloudinary` — no folder ownership check; any authenticated user can obtain a valid upload signature for another user's spot folder~~
    - Input changed from `folder?: string` to `spotId: uuid`; server queries `spot.creatorId`, throws `ForbiddenError` if mismatch
    - File: `src/server/routes/media.ts` → `signCloudinary` procedure

29. ✅ ~~`media.create` — `thumbnailUrl` and `lightboxUrl` accept any URL, allowing external URL injection~~
    - Added `.refine()` on both fields requiring `https://res.cloudinary.com/{VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME}/` prefix
    - File: `src/server/routes/media.ts` → `create` input schema

30. 🟡 **P2** `[ux]` Owner's upload gallery shows watermarked lightbox after page refresh
    - During active session: `previewUrl` is a local blob URL (no watermark) ✓
    - After refresh: drafts fall back to `draft.lightboxUrl` which is the watermarked public variant ✗
    - Fix: add a third eager transform `t_wave_atlas_lightbox_owner` (800px, no watermark, authenticated delivery); store in a new `ownerLightboxUrl` DB column
    - Requires: new Cloudinary named transform, Prisma migration, updated `MediaRepository.create`, updated `UploadPipeline.saveToDatabase`

31. 🟡 **P2** `[perf]` `media.updateBatch` issues 2 DB reads per item — collapse to 1
    - `ensureCanModify()` → `findById` (read #1); then route → `findById` again for status check (read #2)
    - 20-item batch = 40 DB round-trips instead of 20
    - Fix: extend `ensureCanModify()` to also return status, or add `ensureCanModifyDraft(userId, mediaId)` checking ownership + `DRAFT` status in one query
    - Files: `MediaAuthorizationService.ts`, `src/server/routes/media.ts` → `updateBatch`

32. 🟡 **P2** `[refactor]` Rename `photographerId` → `ownerId` / `authorId` / `creatorId` across the codebase

33. ✅ ~~Add structured server-side logger — replace all raw `console.*` calls~~
    - `src/shared/lib/logger.ts` created with class-based Logger: env-aware pretty-print (dev) vs JSON (prod)
    - `CloudinaryService.tryGeneratePermanentPreviewUrl` migrated to `logger.warn`
    - Webhook handler uses `logger.error`
    - Remaining: one raw `console.log` in `src/server/index.ts` startup message (non-sensitive, low priority)

34. 🟡 **P2** `[perf]` Gallery infinite scroll + virtualised list
    - Spot galleries (GlobeScene, SpotPanel) load all media upfront — will degrade as data grows
    - **Server**: add `cursor`/`limit` to `spots.details` or a new `media.listBySpot` tRPC procedure (Prisma cursor pagination)
    - **Client**: replace `useQuery` → `useInfiniteQuery`; `getNextPageParam` reads last item id as cursor
    - **Virtualise**: use `@tanstack/react-virtual` (`useVirtualizer`) — only visible rows rendered in DOM
    - Scope excludes `_drawer.me.purchases.tsx` — 50-item cap is sufficient for purchases
    - Files: `views/SpotPanel`, `views/GlobeScene`, relevant tRPC routes

35. 🟢 **P3** `[perf]` Prefetch lightbox image on card hover in purchases gallery
    - Currently the full-res Cloudinary URL loads only when the modal opens → 1–3 s blank modal on slow connections
    - Fix: `queryClient.prefetchQuery` with an `Image` object `onload` promise; browser caches before modal opens
    - File: `src/app/routes/_drawer.me.purchases.tsx` — add `onMouseEnter` to each `<Card>`

36. ✅ ~~Upload pipeline missing validation guards~~
    1. ✅ ~~**Folder ownership**: verify the target spot belongs to the current user before signing (see #28)~~
    2. ✅ ~~**File type whitelist**: `resource_type` in `mediaCloudinaryResultSchema` changed from `z.string()` to `z.enum(['image', 'video'])`~~
    3. ✅ ~~**File size limit**: guard added at top of `uploadToCloudinary` in `cloudinaryTransport.ts`; rejects with `FILE_TOO_LARGE` before XHR starts; uses `MEDIA_UPLOAD_LIMITS` constants~~
    4. ✅ ~~**Rate limiting**: `createRateLimiter` utility in `src/server/lib/rateLimiter.ts`; `signCloudinary` capped at 10/user/min via tRPC `.use()` middleware~~

37. ✅ ~~Webhook endpoint rate limiting — replay-flood DoS~~
    - `webhookLimiter` (20 req/IP/min) added to `/api/webhook/cryptocloud` in `src/server/index.ts`
    - Uses same `createRateLimiter` utility as #36.4
    - IP extracted from `x-forwarded-for` / `cf-connecting-ip` headers

38. ✅ ~~Webhook fulfillment: non-atomic idempotency check — vulnerable to race-condition double fulfillment~~
    - `@@unique` on `externalOrderId` was already in the schema
    - `PurchaseFulfillmentService.fulfillOrder` now catches `ConflictError` (P2002) as idempotent success

39. ✅ ~~Wire `PrismaErrorMapper` into all repositories~~
    - All repositories (`Media`, `Order`, `Purchase`, `Spot`, `User`) already use `runQuery` from `BaseRepository`, which calls `mapPrismaError` in its catch — P2002/P2025 are fully mapped

40. ✅ ~~Payment adapters throw plain `new Error()` — internal provider details may leak to the client~~
    - `createCheckoutSession` HTTP error + unexpected response: now `logger.error(...)` + `throw new BadGatewayError('Payment provider error')`
    - `parseWebhookEvent` non-success status: no longer throws — returns `{ type: 'order.ignored' }` (safe, webhook handler already gates on `order.completed`)
    - `PaymentWebhookEvent` type extended to discriminated union `'order.completed' | 'order.ignored'`
    - File: `src/server/lib/payment/CryptoCloudAdapter.ts`, `src/server/lib/payment/PaymentAdapter.ts`

41. ✅ ~~Webhook handler has no try/catch around `handleEvent` — uncontrolled 500 exposes stack traces and triggers dangerous provider retries on partially-written fulfillments~~
    - Wrapped `fulfillOrder` in try/catch; logs via `logger.error`; returns controlled `{ error: 'Fulfillment error' }` with status 500

42. ✅ ~~Flatten `SpotRepository.ts` — remove `ISpotRepository` interface and `PrismaSpotRepository` class; replace with plain exported async functions~~

43. ✅ ~~Flatten `OrderRepository.ts` — remove `IOrderRepository`, `PrismaOrderRepository`, and `orderRepository` singleton; keep named exports~~

44. ✅ **P1** `[server]` `PurchaseFulfillmentService.ts` bypasses the repository layer — calls `prisma.mediaItem.findMany` and `prisma.$transaction` directly
    - Discovered during `users.ts` audit (April 2026)
    - Fix: add `MediaRepository.findByIds()`; verify `$transaction` block is fully delegated to `OrderRepository.fulfill`

45. ✅ ~~`spots.ts` tRPC route calls `prisma.mediaItem.findMany` directly (line ~131) — should go through `MediaRepository`~~
    - Added `findDraftsBySpot(spotId, photographerId)` to `MediaRepository`; `spots.ts` now delegates to it and no longer imports `prisma` directly

46. ✅ ~~`CheckoutService.ts` leaks `Prisma.Decimal` above the repository boundary~~

47. ✅ **P2** `[refactor]` `MediaAuthorizationService.ts` uses a class + interface pattern inconsistent with the rest of the services layer
    - All other services (`CheckoutService`, `PurchaseFulfillmentService`, `CloudinaryService`) export plain functions or a singleton object
    - `IMediaAuthorizationService` interface and `MediaAuthorizationService` class exist solely for constructor DI, used only in tests via mock injection
    - Fix: replace class with plain exported functions; use `vi.mock` in tests instead of constructor injection
    - Files: `MediaAuthorizationService.ts`, any test files importing it

48. 🟡 **P2** `[bug]` thumnails in galleries using image with watermark. only public lightboxes should be with watermark.

49. 🟢 **P3** `[refactor]` Hook logging and tracing into `runQuery` utility
    - Class-based `BaseRepository` was considered and rejected — plain `runQuery` in `BaseRepository.ts` is sufficient
    - `runQuery` already handles error mapping (via `mapPrismaError`); it is the single cross-cutting entry point
    - Remaining work: add optional `operationName?: string` param; call `logger.error` inside the catch block
    - Each call site passes `'RepositoryName.methodName'` — no class or `this.constructor.name` needed
    - Prerequisite: #33 (structured logger) must land first
    - Enables: consistent error logging and future tracing across all repos in one place
